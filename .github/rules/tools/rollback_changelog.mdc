# rollback_changelog
When instructed to rollback a changelog. Always start by looking at the `.ai/state.md` file and finding the `current_migration` in the frontmatter.
Analyze the contents of the changelog, then plan out an approach for rolling-back the changes. Be pragmatic with the approach.
After that, update the changelog to uncheck the changes that were un-applied
Then finally, update `.ai/state.md` to reflect the recent rollback.

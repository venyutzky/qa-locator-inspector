## Locator Priority

The extension follows QA best practices for locator generation:

### CSS Selectors (Primary)
1. **ID Attribute** - `#login-btn`
2. **Name Attribute** - `[name="submit"]`
3. **Placeholder Text** - `[placeholder="Enter username"]`
4. **Unique Classes** - `.login-form-submit`
5. **Attribute Combinations** - `button[type="submit"][class="btn-primary"]`
6. **Structural Selectors** - `:nth-child()` as fallback

### XPath (Fallback)
1. **Text-based** - `//button[text()="Login"]`
2. **Attribute-based** - `//input[@name="username"]`
3. **Relative positioning** - `//form[@class="login"]//button`
